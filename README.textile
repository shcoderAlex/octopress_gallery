h1. Octopress Gallery Plugin:

* minimagick.rb: this plugin will automatically generate thumbnails and resize any image file (png,jpg,jpeg,gif) contained in any sub folder added to this location /source/images/galleries.

* gallery_tag.rb: this plugin will create an image list from each gallery folder present in /source/images/galleries. You can easily change the path reflecting your own working directory structure by setting your own BASE_DIR in gallery_tag.rb.

h2. Install:

* copy both plugins or clone this repo in your octopress_project/plugins folder.

h2. MiniMagick Plugin (mini_magick.rb):

* Add mini_magick to your Gemfile

<pre>
  <code>
  #Gemfile
  gem 'mini_magick'
  </code>
</pre>

* create a new "galleries" folder in your octopress_project/source/images dir (you can choose to edit this accordingly to the value of BASE_DIR in gallery_tag.rb).

* add some folders with images (those can be any png,jpg,jpeg,gif) to your newly created "source/images/galleries" dir:

<pre>
  <code>
  |-galleries
  |---gallery_1
  |------image1.jpg
  |------image2.jpg
  |---gallery_2
  |------image3.jpg
  |------image4.jpg
  </code>
</pre>

* this will automatically loop through each gallery folder and manipulate images based on the commands defined in your _config.yml file (adjust and edit settings accordingly to your own needs).

<pre>
  <code>
  # _config.yml
  mini_magick:
    gallery_1_thumbnail:
      source: images/galleries/gallery_1
      destination: images/galleries/gallery_1/thumbs
      commands:
        - thumbnail: "140x140^"
        - crop: "140x140-0x0"
    gallery_1_medium:
      source: images/galleries/gallery_1
      destination: images/galleries/gallery_1/medium
      commands:
        - resize: "600x400"
    gallery_2_thumbnail:
      source: images/galleries/gallery_2
      destination: images/galleries/gallery_2/thumbs
      commands:
        - thumbnail: "140x140^"
        - crop: "140x140-0x0"
    gallery_2_medium:
      source: images/galleries/test
      destination: images/galleries/gallery_2/medium
      commands:
        - resize: "200x200"
  </code>
</pre>


h2. Gallery Plugin (gallery_tag.rb):

* create a new post (or page) in source/_posts and add the image_list liquid filter (don't forget to pass it the name of the gallery folder: e.g. in this post I am creating the image_list for the gallery_1 folder in images/galleries so i am passing the name of the corresponding folder 'gallery_1')

<pre>
  <code>
    #source/_posts/gallery_post.textile
    --- 
    layout: post
    title: gallery post
    categories: my category
    ---
    
      {{ 'gallery_1' | image_list }}
      
  </code>
</pre>

* edit or modify the generated code in gallery_tag.rb to make it work with lightbox, fancybox or any other additional piece of js you are using to enhance your generated image gallery list.

h2. Generate Site:

* This will automatically call both plugins

<pre>
  <code>
    $: rake generate
  </code>
</pre>
